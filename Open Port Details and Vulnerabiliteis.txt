Port	Protocol	State	Common Service		Description
22	TCP		open		SSH		Used for secure shell access to the system. If exposed to the internet, it's often targeted by brute-force attacks.
53	TCP		open		DNS (Domain)    Typically used for DNS queries. TCP is used when responses are large or for zone transfers. Often expected on DNS servers.
80	TCP		open		HTTP	        Used for unencrypted web traffic. If this is a web server, it's serving content over HTTP.
1900	TCP		open		UPNP	   	Universal Plug and Play. Typically uses UDP (not TCP), so TCP on 1900 is unusual and may indicate a misconfiguration or non-standard service.






Port 22 – SSH

Vulnerabilities:

    Brute-force attacks

    Weak/default credentials

    Outdated versions (e.g., CVE-2018-15473)

    Insecure key management

Mitigations:

    Use key-based auth

    Disable root login

    Limit access via firewall

    Use fail2ban

    Keep SSH updated

Port 53 – DNS

Vulnerabilities:

    DNS cache poisoning

    DNS amplification

    Zone transfer leaks

    RCE in DNS software (e.g., BIND)

Mitigations:

    Disable recursion externally

    Restrict zone transfers

    Use rate limiting

    Keep DNS software updated

Port 80 – HTTP

Vulnerabilities:

    Unencrypted traffic

    XSS, SQL injection, RCE

    Outdated web servers/CMS

Mitigations:

    Use HTTPS

    Sanitize inputs

    Patch web apps and servers

    Use WAF

Port 1900 – UPNP (Unusual on TCP)

Vulnerabilities:

    Exposes internal devices

    Remote code execution

    DDoS amplification (usually via UDP)

Mitigations:

    Disable UPnP if not needed

    Block port externally

    Monitor for unusual activity
